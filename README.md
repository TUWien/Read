# Read
Contains main cmake to build to complete READ system (nomacs, ReadFramework, and ReadModules). The READ project has received funding from the European Unionâ€™s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 674943.

note: to use this repository you need a github user and a publickey has to be uplodated to github (submodules of git are referenced via the ssh git@github.com url)

## Build on Windows

todo

## Build on Ubuntu
note: Qt 5.5 is needed, thus Ubuntu version must be >= 16.04 or backports of Qt 5.5 have to be used (see .travis.yml for an ppa repository and names packages which need to be installed)

Get required packages:

``` console
sudo apt-get install qt5-qmake qttools5-dev-tools qt5-default libqt5svg5-dev qt5-image-formats-plugins libopencv-dev cmake git libexiv2-dev libraw-dev
```

Get sources from github:
``` console
git clone https://github.com/TUWien/Read
```
This will by default place the source into ./Read
Go to the Read directory and update the submodules
``` console
cd Read
git submodule update --init --remote --merge
cmake .
```
Compile READ: 
``` console
make
```

The binaries are then located in a new Directory called "READ" (./Read/READ)
